Each 24-hour duty must mandatorily include set number of interns as mentioned in the schedule, rotating internally within the assigned subgroup.  Swaps or replacements are strictly prohibited without valid justification and prior approval from the department.   No post-duty off is permitted, and interns must report to regular duties the following morning without exception. Failure to report for duty without prior intimation will result in reposting or extension of the internship.
